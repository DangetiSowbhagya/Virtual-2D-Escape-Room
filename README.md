# Virtual-2D-Escape-Room
This project is an interactive 2D escape room game controlled entirely through Voice Commands. 
This is built using Pygame for the visual interface and SpeechRecognition for real-time voice input , players use voice commands to solve puzzles, interact with objects and navigate the game world .

# Key Features:
Voice-Based Controls:
1) Issue commands like " open shelf" , "pick up the key" for immersive and hands-free gameplay.
2)Modular Game Design : Clearly structured code with dedicated modules for game logic , voice processing and action mapping.
3)Parallel Voice Capture: Used "threading" for smooth real-time voice recognition while keeping gameplay responsive.
It is an open-source and cost-effective.   
-Puzzle-Solving Mechanics:
Engage with interactive escape room elements.

# Tech Stack:
Python3,
Pygame,
